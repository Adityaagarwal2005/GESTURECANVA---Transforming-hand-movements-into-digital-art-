GESTURECANVAS-->Real-Time Hand Detection & Drawing with Fingertip

FingerDraw is a real-time computer vision project that uses Google’s pre-trained MediaPipe Hands model and OpenCV to let you draw on the screen using just your fingertip 🖌️ — no mouse, no touchscreen required!

The project tracks your hand from a webcam feed, identifies the index fingertip among 21 hand landmarks, and draws wherever you point — like a virtual pen in the air.
